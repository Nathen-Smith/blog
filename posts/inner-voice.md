The toughest semester of my life was fall/winter 2020. I was entirely consumed by what was regarded as the toughest class in my major. In my free time, I loved watching cooking videos, so I really had nothing going on besides school and food. When reflecting on how that semester felt, the best way to describe it was that it was one long marathon—the days all merged into one.

I felt reborn going into winter break. Overwhelming clarity and feelings of being refreshed hit like waves as I left campus and got on the airplane for home. But what was I to do without needing to worry about school or cooking? Lucky for me, my subconscious made plans. Having spent a whole semester practically giving no time to simply sit down and be with my thoughts, my subconscious was neglected and gasping for air. In particular, it was dying to tell me that I was not fulfilled and was losing touch with former hobbies.

While my subconscious thoughts briefly surfaced in the form of the occasional shower thought, I still had given no time to the inner voice. Why was this important? For one, the inner voice impacts how you view yourself and hear others. In _You're Not Listening_ by Kate Murphy, Murphy illustrates this by contrasting two voices:

> an inner voice that says, Are you sure you want to do that? Why don’t you put yourself in their shoes? And Yeah, that was hurtful, but maybe they didn’t intend to hurt you, is a very different voice from the one that says, They are all out to get me and I’m no good. The latter voice is the one that makes you react in ways that are not to your benefit (Murphy 2020, 131)

By internalizing the qualities of the second voice, one is more likely to become more bitter and self-loathing, which is only reinforced when social interactions are perceived as worse than they actually were. The subconscious becomes intrusive and erratic, and the inner voice becomes irrational: resulting in a cloudy and unhappy mind. On the other hand, internalizing the qualities of the first voice makes you more understanding and empathetic. Most importantly, you will feel at peace.

When the inner dialogue is constructive and collaborative, it also makes problem solving easy—which is what I use the inner voice the most for. The solution usually already resides in you, you just have to develop it. Or sometimes it's an irrational thought or you're overthinking. I am a frequent and organized journaler—just a glance at my Notes app will tell you how big of a role my inner voice plays in my decision making and problem solving. My journal categories are as follows: ‘Career’, ‘Planning’, ‘Processing’, ‘Questions’, ‘Self Help’, ‘Struggles’, ‘Workout’, ‘Awakenings’, ‘Decision Making’, and ‘Brain Dump’. Whenever I get a bothersome feeling from the subconscious, I try to develop it out with the inner voice, resolve any problems, then categorize it. This has led to a kinder and more collaborative inner voice as well as a freedom from mind, which I believe is the key for happiness.

Unfortunately for most people, their inner voice is unhelpful. People take great lengths to shut out their inner voice, probably because it nags them or brings up trauma. But the longer the subconscious and inner voice are neglected, the louder they become. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a great solution for this.

I would like to close with a final quote from Murphy, inviting the reader to consider their inner voice:

> Who does your inner voice remind you of? What does it tell you? Does your inner voice sound different in different situations? Is it friendly? Is it critical? These are all important things to ask yourself because your inner voice influences how you ponder things, interpret situations, make moral judgments, and solve problems. This, in turn, influences how you are in the world; whether you see the best or worst in people and whether you see the best or worst in yourself (Murphy 2020, 133)
