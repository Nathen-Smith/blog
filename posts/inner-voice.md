December 2020. I had just finished the toughest semester of my life. I was taking Operating Systems as well as Data Structures and Algorithms, where people usually take the latter a semester before the former, not together. In order to de-stress, I loved watching cooking videos so I really had nothing going on besides school and food. When reflecting on how that semester felt, the best way to describe it was that it was a long marathon—the days all merged into one.

I almost felt reborn going into winter break and going home. Overwhelming clarity and feelings of being refreshed hit like waves as I left campus and got on the airplane.
Only what was I to do without school or cooking to worry about? Well, my mind decided for me. I had an enlightenment on the relation between the subconscious and the conscious.

> As a definition, the conscious is everything reachable by your inner voice: thoughts and awareness. The subconscious is everything else. We could further break it down by reactions and impressions (samskara).

So what had I realized? The subconscious was trying to send me messages. A whole semester flew by and I had barely given myself time to think. I had essentially suppressed my subconscious. I had similarly neglected my inner voice. Why was this important? As summarized in “You’re Not Listening” by Kate Murphy, listening to your inner voice helps with problem solving:

> “many great philosophers and social theorists, including William James, Charles Sanders Peirce, and George Herbert Mead, believed the self generated conversations with itself by taking the perspective of another. An example is an athlete who might internalize the voice of a coach. Or you might have a back-and-forth with yourself that resembles exchanges you've had with your mother, boss, spouse, sibling, friend, or maybe a therapist”(p.129).

When the inner dialogue is constructive and you work together it makes problem solving easy—just a glance at how my journal is organized will tell you how big of a role my inner voice plays in my decision making and problems.

Here are my main categories:

- Career
- Planning
- Processing
- Questions
- Self Help
- Struggles
- Workout
- Awakenings
- Decision Making
- Brain Dump
- Sad Thoughts

Whenever I get a bothersome feeling from the subconscious, I try to develop it out with the inner voice, resolve any problems, then categorize it. This has led to a freedom from mind, which I believe is the key for happiness.

Unfortunately for most people, their inner voice is unhelpful. As put by Murphy, “an inner voice that says, Are you sure you want to do that? Why don’t you put yourself in their shoes? And Yeah, that was hurtful, but maybe they didn’t intend to hurt you, is a very different voice from the one that says, They are all out to get me and I’m no good. The latter voice is the one that makes you react in ways that are not to your benefit”(p.131). People go great lengths to avoid their inner voice, probably because it nags them or brings up trauma. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a great solution for this.
