A month ago, I went on a trip to Chicago. It was an incredible trip, and I felt
like a true local by the end. We had many different lifestyle changes during the
vacation. For one, we only used walking and public transit for transportation,
except the occasional Uber to and from the bar üò∏. The blinds were not as strong
as at home, so I woke up naturally to the sunlight instead of my alarm. Also, I
liked neither hot pot nor dumplings (I do not believe in Din Tai Fung), but my
convictions got 180‚Äôd thanks to Wagyu House and Qing Xiang Yuan Dumplings.

I had plenty of meaningful conversations with friends and meeting mutuals. One
day, I took public transit alone to meet my good friend Anwesa. We had a
fantastic time exploring the city‚ÄîNavy Pier Ferris Wheel and New Eastside
neighborhood‚Äîand talking about friends, relationships, city life, work and grad
school, hobbies and phases, plans, and dreams while injecting humor and having
fun. I was so content.

But after the trip, a previously unchallenged lifestyle habit changed. I stopped
playing video games cold. I used to play daily, getting into the meta, lore, and
builds and sometimes playing for hours with friends. I‚Äôd been playing video
games consistently for over ten years, and they have been a big part of my
upbringing. When I was bored after my trip, I tried some solo video games, but
they only left me feeling‚Ä¶relatively empty. My desire for video games had died.
Honestly, the change didn‚Äôt affect me. I just kept going forward. My vacation
convinced me that you don‚Äôt need such supplements.

Curious to hear if others have experienced similar changes, I found a Reddit
post in the r/solotravel community that resonated with my experience:

I agree 100% with the sentiment in the post. This was happening precisely to me.
And I was curious to hear others' opinions on it. The top comment, by
u/imbeingsirius, with more upvotes than the original post, provides
thought-provoking and sound reasoning:

_Insert gif of a goth teenager exclaiming, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just a phase, Mom!!‚Äù_

Yes, it is very typical to have change, but we can also drastically shift our
interests to categorize sections of our lives in phases. Phases are a relatively
normal thing and shouldn‚Äôt fire off an alarm in your head just because you
stopped being a gamer/grass toucher/whatever. Following what a commenter said,
these things come and go in waves. We are dynamic.

However, u/imbeingsirius's trip guide's brilliance sets this comment apart,
advising and asserting ‚Äúno pop culture discussion.‚Äù But first, what counts as
pop culture? User u/FailedCustomer explains:

> Anything like social media related mainstream, new music/concerts by hyped
> artists, video-games, fictional stuff like comics, Marvel, DC, Star Wars,
> anime as well, all the stuff going on in cinema, or celebrities related
> stories. Some could even say discussing JDM cars is pop culture.

So, a lot of things. But fictional, man-made things. u/imbeingsirius also
replied:

> Any show/movie. No ‚Äúhave you seen X?‚Äù Questions. Crazy hard to follow but it
> got easier by the end of the week. Someone brought along the Harry Potter
> series and that became something we read aloud at night :) even better because
> several members of the group had never read it

Wait what? Harry Potter would count as pop culture, right? Yes, it does. So, did
they bend the rules on u/imbeingsirius‚Äôs backpacking trip? Another user called
this out, so u/imbeingsirius clarifies:

> [Harry Potter is pop culture], but the distinction was between daytime
> conversations vs a nighttime group story. Like we didn‚Äôt talk about Harry
> Potter during the day, it was an after dinner treat just to listen.

So, ultimately, discussions involving pop culture were treated as off-limits,
thus establishing a stigma towards the topic.

## Comments on ‚ÄúNo Pop Culture‚Äù in Conversation

The concept of bundling movies, celebrities, and fiction into one
group‚Äîartificial consumerist BS‚Äîis new to me, but it will stay with me when
choosing my conversation topics. A lot of times, we use these works as
distractions. We sometimes get so involved that our constant need for
entertainment has blurred the line between fiction and reality in everyday life
(Henderson, 2023). Escaping from reality is a scary road and will render us
incompetent.

While the stigma towards video games and being involved with celebrities' lives
isn‚Äôt new, bundling fiction works under this category is particularly
interesting. This is because it encompasses fictional books, music, and cinema.
These widely enjoyed mediums won‚Äôt disappear anytime soon and can provide lots
of meaning. At best, these works show characters and behaviors that we can
relate to our relationships and develop an understanding and empathy towards. We
can learn fun and attractive personality traits and qualities that we can adopt
in our disposition and enhance meaning in our lives. So, flat-out cutting these
things from your lives is a tall order.

But, there is some truth to avoiding conversation around such topics. Have you
ever talked to someone about a TV show? How far did the conversation go besides
a simple ‚Äúyeah‚Äù and ‚Äúyep, I felt the same way‚Äù? And if they go far, it‚Äôs most
likely someone explaining something to someone else. And it‚Äôs all pretty
meaningless. So yeah, TV shows are relatively lackluster for conversation
topics. Movies can be good conversation topics; it‚Äôs always fun to discuss right
after you watch a movie at the theater with your friends. However, they are
still other-focused, making for a decent leisure activity and not much more.

What about talking about video games? I‚Äôd say the topic is meaningful when
focused on another person, especially when they have some autonomy in the video
game. For example, if someone has a specific video game build that is very
quirky and unique, that would be interesting to talk about. Challenges or goals
within the game that the person is currently trying to get are also good for
conversation. And, of course, just learning about someone‚Äôs simple pleasures is
always great.

I‚Äôd say that uncommon slang is also part of the pop culture category. Obscure
slang does not add much to conversation but sometimes can be funny.

To serve as a general guideline about talking (and what to pursue personally)
about these forms of leisure, we can look towards _Leisure and Meaning in Life_
by Iso-Ahola & Baumeister (2023):

- The present activities draw meaning from the future, such as aspirational
  goals or fulfillment states.
  - TV watching is lacking in either goals or fulfillment states
  - Creative hobbies such as playing a musical instrument or painting have
    abundant goals and sometimes offer fulfillment states (i.e., the ecstasy of
    artistic creation)
- Some activities are psychologically meaningful because they often have a
  strong relationship between challenge and enjoyment. The challenge-enjoyment
  relationship is most potent for intrinsically motivated, goal-directed
  activities.
  - E.g., sports, games, finishing a hike, solving a puzzle
- There is also ‚Äúserious leisure,‚Äù which entails a commitment to long-term
  goals, e.g., volunteering to help the environment, playing in a band

So, creative hobbies, sports, games, and goal-directed activities are among the
best forms of leisure as they provide meaning through goals and fulfillment
states. All these are good for personal use and curiosity in conversation.

## What do we talk about if Pop Culture is Off Limits?

First, it is crucial to consider the context in which u/imbeingsirius received
the advice to avoid talking about pop culture‚Äîit was a paid course designed to
teach leadership and wilderness skills (NOLS, 2024). Therefore, it makes sense
to avoid pop culture discussions as they will be directly counterproductive to
the course guide‚Äôs teachings. Another thing to consider is that course members
are from diverse backgrounds and cultures, so pop culture references in
conversation will cause some disconnect. The ‚Äúno pop culture‚Äù rule is a blessing
in disguise as it will limit conversations to reality. Sooner or later, you will
be running out of topics, so you will get curious about someone and put in the
effort to get to know them. This way, you will form genuine connections. None of
this is saying to eliminate pop culture conversations; granted, the tour guide
allowed pop culture discussions at night. The rule to avoid talking about pop
culture should be taken as a guiding principle to have better conversations. A
good takeaway is to focus on the present and hone in on others.

As for different conversation topics, one guideline I like is the F.O.R.D. rule,
which stands for Family, Occupation, Relationships, and Dreams. However,
remember that some of these topics may differ from person to person. Some may
not be very close with their family. Others may hate talking about their job.
Prying into someone else‚Äôs relationships may be overstepping boundaries. If you
want something more accessible, try to learn someone else‚Äôs simple pleasures‚Äîbut
with ‚Äúlately‚Äù injected to emphasize the present and make questions easier to
answer. Meaningful leisure and one-off meaningful conversations about pop
culture are good, too.

With good friends or your partner, giving your undivided attention for 90-120
minutes every day is ideal. Try to learn about your friends and be genuinely
curious about what they have to say. As for listening, just read _You‚Äôre Not
Listening_ by Kate Murphy. I‚Äôve referenced it so much already that I don‚Äôt need
to discuss it more.

In addition to avoiding pop culture in conversation, we must focus more on the
present and reality‚Äîeven if it‚Äôs just commenting on the surrounding area or
checking in to see if someone else needs more water. Also, hopefully, this will
provide a framework for categorizing conversation topics into pop culture or
not. Challenge yourself and try avoiding pop culture in a conversation! It may
be more serious to try it out, but you can reduce the intensity by injecting
humor. If you give attention, receive attention, and laugh a little‚Äîthat‚Äôs a
fulfilling interaction.
