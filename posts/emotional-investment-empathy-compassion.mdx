## Emotional investment

Allowing yourself to be emotionally invested is essential in enhancing our
lives, and it is a building block for compassion, love, and meaning. If you’re
not emotionally invested in a movie, book, or TV show, you won’t get much out of
it—the entertainment is diluted, and you are robbed of potential new
understanding. In order to be emotionally invested, we need to be (You guessed!)
open with our emotions. Unfortunately, this is where the difficulty lies, as
what we learn in our society is not how to work with our emotions but how to
block and avoid them, i.e., screen time, drugs, and alcohol abuse (Hendel,
2018). Furthermore, we are afflicted by things that can harm our ability to
regulate and process emotions, such as internet and video game addiction.

How do we define investment? Typically, we think of investment in monetary
terms: you invest money to make money, or you invest in education. The goal is
to have the asset appreciate, and it can either do that or not.

A similarity between typical and emotional investments is that we can quit them.
Like an investor backing out to minimize losses, one may stop reading a novel
because it became too creepy. However, unlike simply increasing or decreasing
the money we have invested, we cannot control how much emotional investment we
have. In fact, we rarely even consider it: emotional investment typically arises
when we question whether we enjoy something, like a TV show or novel. For
example, we might tell a friend that we don’t mind if they watch a TV show
episode without us because we were not [emotionally] invested.

One of the best things that can happen by being emotionally invested in
something is a greater understanding of life or people. Keeping in mind that the
process of emotional investing is open-ended, it might look like this: You first
pick up a novel because it was highly rated and you like some of the topics it
covers. Then, as you watch the characters develop, you start to draw parallels
with some people or patterns of thought you’ve encountered: thus allowing you to
understand and empathize with others better.

This phenomenon happened when I read Bonnie Garmus’s novel, _Lessons in
Chemistry_, where the main character views everything in life, including
motherhood and prejudice, through a scientific lens. A characteristic of these
highly logical people that stuck with me was the tendency to plan:

> ‘Life is a mystery, isn’t it? People who try to plan it inevitably end up
> disappointed.’ She nodded. She was a planner. She was disappointed (Garmus,
> 2022, p. 209)

Those with scientific minds love to prepare for the worst and plan things weeks
in advance, but life often throws curveballs. When our careful and detailed
plans get messed up, it’s not unnatural for planners to be frustrated or
disappointed. By understanding this tendency, one can develop empathy toward
these patterns.

Emotional investment only sometimes gives us a greater understanding of life or
people, which is okay. Most entertainment exists purely to create joy.
Nevertheless, like how relief cannot exist without pain, joy needs a contrast.
Whether the pleasure in something comes from winning on a bet, overcoming
misfortune, or solving challenging problems, these scenarios only affect you to
the degree of your emotional investment.

Unfortunately, avoiding and blocking our emotions is becoming widespread due to
our environment and the modern addiction to distraction. In addition, internet
and video game addictions decrease the ability to regulate and process emotions
(Cheng & Liu, 2020; Ko et al., 2015), adding to the vicious cycle of distracting
yourself from listening to your internals.

However, the worst case is when media feeds off your emotions, resulting in a
cycle of anxiety. A classic example of this is social media. In 2016, Woods &
Scott used the Social Media Use Integration Scale (Jenkins-Guarnieri, Wright, &
Johnson, 2013) to assess emotional investment in social media. The scale has
items you agree/disagree on, like “I get upset when I can't log on to social
media.” Over 467 pupils at a secondary school in the United Kingdom,
Taylor-Jackson & Moustafa (2020) summarize Woods & Scott’s results:

> They found significant positive correlations between higher anxiety levels,
> greater social media use, and emotional investment in social media. Similarly,
> higher depression levels were associated with increased social media use and
> emotional investment in social media. The relationship between self-esteem and
> social media use was found to be negative, whereby lower self-esteem scores
> were associated with higher levels of social media use and emotional
> investment in social media (Woods & Scott, 2016, as cited in Taylor-Jackson &
> Moustafa, 2020)

Social media can have benefits like connecting with friends and providing
entertainment, but becoming emotionally invested in it has adverse effects—there
is always the pressure to fit in and present yourself as a perfect being, not to
mention FoMo. Some media outlets also use your emotional investment against you,
which is true in fear-mongering and McCarthyism.

On the other hand, the best thing to do with emotional investment is to direct
it toward people. Empathy cannot be without sacrificing some emotions to imagine
what others are going through. You can act upon these feelings and foster
compassion with sufficient emotional investment. Before going further, let’s
define the two:

## Empathy

Empathy is the ability to understand and respond to the unique affective
experiences of another person (Decety & Jackson, 2006). If we consider empathy
at the level of experience, it is essentially a psychological construct that
denotes a sense of similarity between one’s own feelings and those expressed by
another person (Seiler & Craig, 2016). We can also view empathy as an
interaction between two individuals who share each other’s experiences and
feelings. However, this exchange of feelings does not necessarily mean that one
will act or even feel compelled to act in support or sympathize.

Decety and Jackson (2006) presented empathy as an inductive process resulting
from the interaction of two elements: mirror neurons activation, allowing an
internal representation of the other person’s affect as a feeling or felt-sense
and cognitive processes, allowing perspective-taking, self-consciousness, and
emotional regulation (Bibeau et al., 2016).

The key here is that empathy so defined does not necessarily imply a desire to
help, nor does it automatically lead to action (Bibeau et al., 2016).

## Compassion

The online Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines compassion as “a sympathetic
consciousness of other's distress together with a desire to alleviate it”
(Bibeau et al., 2016). ​​Siegel and Germer (2012) proposed a shorthand
operational definition of compassion as “the experience of suffering with the
wish to alleviate it” (p.12, as cited in Bibeau et al., 2016). Note the emphasis
on another one’s distress; empathy pertains to any emotion.

## The Modern Decline in Empathy

Empathy has never been more important due to our modern environment. Today, we
are spending an increasing proportion of our time with computers. As machines
are incapable of emotion, we may view them as nothing more than a tool, thus
giving rise to uncompassionate treatment. With increased computer usage, we may
treat humans the same: less compassionate and devoid of empathy.

Furthermore, computers are not capable of empathy. Even with the recent
developments in AI chatbots, this still holds; ChatGPT agrees:

> N: Are computers or AI capable of empathetic thinking?

> ChatGPT: As an AI language model, I can provide information on this topic.
> While computers and AI can simulate empathy to a certain extent, they do not
> have true empathetic thinking like humans.

> ChatGPT: Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of
> others. While AI can process vast amounts of data and recognize patterns in
> human emotions, it lacks the emotional intelligence and subjective experience
> necessary for true empathetic thinking.

> ChatGPT: However, researchers are exploring ways to create AI systems that can
> better recognize and respond to human emotions, such as facial recognition
> software, speech recognition, and natural language processing. These efforts
> may improve the ability of AI to simulate empathy, but they are unlikely to
> replicate the full range of human emotions and experiences that underlie true
> empathetic thinking.

In addition, the communication systems we use inhibit empathy. For example, text
messages and phone calls do not let us pick up facial expressions, body
language, tone, or clues about what we want to discuss and how we feel. Video
calls under perfect circumstances could replicate an in-person interaction and
produce empathy, but it is unlikely. This is not to say that these forms of
communication cause more harm than good—they allow for ease of communication—but
rather, it is vital to practice empathy given our environment.

Lastly, another inhibiting factor towards the development of empathy is its
evolutionary aspect. We tend to have the most empathy for others who look or act
like us, others who have suffered similarly, or those who share a common goal.
The truth is that empathy is not always an equal opportunity benefactor (Kale et
al., 2011, as cited in Reiss, 2017). Therefore, we must avoid this bias.

## Implications

Some undesirable outcomes of this decline in empathy are as follows:

> Human manifestations of these problems are “the social retardation of
> computer-dependent youth” (Fomichov & Fomichova, 2014) and online harassment
> or cyber-bullying (Heirman & Walrave, 2008; Hinduja & Patchin, 2010; Slonje &
> Smith, 2008; Smith et al., 2008). These have become significant problems
> facing modern society.

> Other examples of technology seeming to reduce empathy are nurses becoming
> less empathetic when using increasing amounts of technology in intensive care
> units (Brunt, 1985), technology reducing the level of service in customer care
> environments (Gorry & Westbrook, 2011), and students becoming dehumanized when
> teachers rely excessively on computers (Nissenbaum & Walker, 1998). (Seiler &
> Craig, 2016)

Empathy is especially crucial in healthcare, and those in that field must be
wary of how our environment and biases can decrease compassion. Uncompassionate
care and treatment are devoid of empathy resulting in dissatisfied patients who
are much less likely to follow treatment recommendations, resulting in poorer
health outcomes and damaged trust in health providers (Reiss, 2017).

In the case of students being dehumanized when teachers rely excessively on
computers, students may lose interest and meaning in that class. In addition, I
have found that the best notes come from teachers who use the chalkboard, not
digital slides: it’s the most similar to pencil and paper (which also your mind
retains better).

## Cultivating Empathy and Compassion

Before recommending solutions, we must examine “How do we cultivate empathy and
compassion” in more detail.

A question to consider is Plato’s age-old question, “Can virtue be taught?
Empathy and compassion need experience and practice; you cannot study to become
empathetic. There are some methods to practice it, however. For example, instead
of focusing from the ground up, we can take the opposite approach and foster
love and kindness.

There is a type of meditation, loving-kindness meditation (AKA compassion and
Metta), which has been scientifically proven to increase empathy and compassion
(Bibeau et al., 2016). In this type of meditation, one imagines one person at a
time: someone you respect (teacher), a friend, a neutral, yourself, someone you
have negative feelings towards, and you direct phrases like

- May you be happy
- May you be free
- May you be at peace

and mustering up as much compassion and love as possible. For more on this, see
[How To Love Yourself | Meditation](https://youtu.be/FQ1d5rC062c) (Kanoija,
2022). Besides enabling you to love yourself and others, a nice side effect of
practicing self-compassion is that it also fosters the intrinsic motivation to
learn and grow, promotes health-related behaviors, and is beneficial for
interpersonal relationships (Neff, 2012; Neff & Pommier, 2012; as cited in
Bibeau et al., 2016).

Directing compassion (self-love) toward yourself may be difficult for a myriad
of reasons (Bibeau et al., 2016; Kanoija, 2022). This is especially the case if
you grew up without unconditional love, or were told that lovability is tied up
in external factors like achievement, your body’s aesthetic, or your lack of
boundaries (Akana, 2023). It will take a great deal of time and practice to
overcome this and develop self-love.

Akana additionally suggests a couple more methods for self-love; one is
practicing your love language on yourself (even for physical touch!). Another is
working on the inner voice, which Akana (2023) puts so succinctly: “When you’re
in an anxiety spiral, you self-soothe. When you’re hurt and angry, you validate
yourself. Become your own best friend” (Akana, 2023)

Unfortunately, this suffers the same fate as much of self-help. Action is
arduous and time-consuming—Akana herself said this process took around five
years (Akana, 2023). Nonetheless, empathy, compassion, and love are worth it. I
would like to finish with a quote from the Dalai Lama: “Love and compassion are
necessities, not luxuries. Without them, humanity cannot survive.”
