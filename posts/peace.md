Imagine a horizontal spectrum, rating people to their degree of hedonistic behavior. On the far left side are the buddhist monks, who live free of desires and pleasures of the world; they do not own any sort of property, wear minimal clothing, are sexually abstinent, and consume just enough food so they do not die. On the far right side are hardcore drug addicts (likely unfortunate victims), who live in oblivion. Now consider this: on the average day to day basis, where do you need to be on this spectrum to be the most happy? There is no one answer.

But first, what is happiness? There are so many different terms that describe feelings closely related to happiness e.g. joy, pleasure, bliss, contentment, well-being. Rather than get hung up on a formal definition, try to consolidate all of these terms and associated feelings into one: let’s assign it to pleasure. You usually feel pleasure at least once per day–maybe you had a great meal, maybe you had fun at the bars or by playing video games. You could say that you were happy because of something that happened today, but for the remainder of this text, let’s attribute the word ‘happiness’ to something else. Naval Ravikant, entrepreneur and philosopher, distinguishes happiness from what I just coined as 'pleasure' in a [podcast](https://nav.al/happiness):

> If you’ve ever gotten drunk or achieved an altered state of mind on psychedelic drugs or through meditation, breathing or other hypnotic techniques, you have experienced brief moments of happiness beyond what you feel on a typical day. Of course, some of this is a fake, pleasure-driven happiness. But there’s truth to it; otherwise, you wouldn’t desire that state. How do you nudge yourself in that direction on a perpetual basis, as opposed to visiting it by stunning your mind into submission and silence? (Ravikant)

Ravikant is referring to the state of peace: “When I say you want to be happy, what I’m actually saying is you want to find peace. We say peace of mind, but what we really want is peace from mind". The one similarity between the monk and the addict is that they both spend their day trying to attain the state of peace: through meditating and oblivion, respectively. The difference though, is that [meditation](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1261481222359801856), in addition to listening to the inner voice, clears clutter in the mind—oblivion merely suppresses. Like cleaning, meditating is harder the more clutter there is in your mind–do you think the addict will find meditating easy? To one who has never tried meditation or meditation-like activities, their subconscious likely has a long queue of emotions and thoughts needing processing. A key distinction to be made, as detailed in Ravikant's guide to meditation linked above, is that the point of meditation is not to become a meditator, but rather provide fasting your mind. As peace is the art of doing nothing, it is hard to pursue it. Nonetheless, it is all the more important in a time where mental gluttony is widespread.

As detailed by Kate Murphy in _You’re not Listening_, the modern addiction is distraction: “like smokers nervously patting their pockets for cigarettes, people get jittery without their phones. Indeed, mental health experts say device dependency has many of the same behavioral, psychological, and neurobiological components as substance abuse" (Murphy 2020, 172). Like it or not, we live in an age where attention is currency. Every video game, social media, and app is designed to grab and keep your attention. Sadly enough, “the quality of your attention doesn’t matter. Indeed, the more divided your attention, the more persuadable you are…our human brains are not equipped to manage the onslaught” (Murphy 2020, 175). So, moderation is necessary to keep our minds focused. One thing to note is even when you're not directly using your phone, it still is detrimental to your attention by just being present:

> A study by psychologists at the University of Essex found that the mere presence of a phone on the table–even if it’s silent–makes those sitting around the table feel more disconnected and disinclined to talk about anything important or meaningful, knowing if they do, they will probably be interrupted”(Murphy 2020, 175).

And while you may say you can multitask and can power through the distractions, consider this: “While you may think you can tune out these kinds of things, research consistently shows that you cannot. The ability to multitask is a delusion. Each input degrades your attention"(Murphy 2020, 177). As exiting a train of thought to focus on a distraction is easier and more rewarding than keeping prolonged attention, we become addicted to distraction. This harms our ability to connect with others on a deep level and hinders our performance. It may also cause you to lose sight of the potential rewards that come from listening to the inner voice. Because of this addiction to distraction, it is not uncommon to find meditating and/or paying attention challenging.

A method I can personally recommend to ease into clearing the mind is journaling. This is not to say it is a replacement for meditation. While meditation is best used for surrendering in the moment and letting thoughts pass through you, journaling is best for going through thoughts. In fact, using either for their inadvisable use case will result in rumination. This potential rumination is not insignificant though, as it likely means something needs further attention. In the case of meditation, some thoughts may arise that are too complex to simply acknowledge and pass through it. Likewise, some emotions may arise when tapping into the inner voice that will be too fleeting and too complex to develop through journaling. For example, maybe you got fired or broke up with someone. You would likely feel inadequate or betrayed. The best way to deal with these emotions is through [processing](https://youtu.be/_tLxPkbXkEc). Journaling is a great medium for processing as the issue is usually well defined and it will be easy to acknowledge the emotions you are feeling, thus accelerating you to find and resolve the identity conflict. Another great use case for journaling is decision making. If it's tough to decide on something, whether it be something big like choosing what major to pursue or something simple like a purchase, you can list out the pros and cons to aid in your decision making. There are other use cases for journaling; however, the others are not pertinent to attaining peace.

One pitfall of journaling is that it's easy to overthink. Ideally, you should go into journaling with topics clearly defined, then you should use the inner voice to sort out the issue at hand. If the inner voice is not in charge, your journaling will be overtaken by subconscious thoughts and emotions. It is easy to end up in rumination for not only these reasons, but also because many people's inner voices are overly critical. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is designed for exactly this. Ultimately, a direct path to using your inner voice is preferred, as in plain old thinking; journaling is the backup plan.

Through meditation and working with the inner voice, the mind becomes quieter and more peaceful, which is what we wanted all along. That is, until, more thoughts come up. Some days, it will feel like all your work has done nothing and you are back at square one. This begs the question, is it even possible to reach a permanent state of peace? Although peace is far from algorithmic, we can say the state of being in peace is. Let's try applying the [halting problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem) to answer if perpetual peace is attainable. Given someone's mind, can we determine if their peace will be interrupted? The only way to confirm this is if that person remained peaceful until they died. Even if someone did this, they likely would’ve had to throw everything away–like the Buddhist monks–in search of this eternal peace. Sure, peace sounds nice, but by cutting out the risks in life, you not only lose the lows, but also the highs. And life simply has too many ups and downs to dissuade us that perpetual peace is worth chasing, especially when breaking the cycle of reincarnation is not on the table. The harsh truth is that you will never be 100% satisfied, happy, or at peace. But you can get significantly closer to those states by becoming more peaceful inside.

If you agree that perpetual peace is something to accept as impossible, you must be wondering if there's anything else to work towards besides listening to your inner voice and meditating. Ravikant argues that there is one thing you can work toward: “there’s an old Sikh saying, 'The name of God is truth.' When you understand certain things and they become a part of you, you naturally become a more peaceful person” (Ravikant). But what even is _truth_, if [“I think, therefore I am”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum)? And what about love? Just food for thought.
