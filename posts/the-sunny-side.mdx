The purpose of Part 1 was to instill awareness by better defining the terms
surrounding happiness. However, settling for the harsh truth that we will never
be 100% satisfied, happy, or at peace seems so dismal. And I don’t know about
you, but I think a quest for philosophical truth doesn’t sound fun either
(although it is essential for developing our beliefs). Instead, I will prescribe
the philosophy of Kurzgesagt, a German organization and animation and design
studio with nearly 20 million subscribers on YouTube. It is called
[optimistic nihilism](https://youtu.be/MBRqu0YOH14):

> You only get one shot at life, which is scary, but it also sets you free. If
> the universe ends in heat death, every humiliation you suffer in your life
> will be forgotten. Every mistake you made will not matter in the end. Every
> bad thing you did will be voided. If our life is all we get to experience,
> then it’s the only thing that matters. If the universe has no principles, the
> only relevant principles are the ones we decide on. If the universe has no
> purpose, we get to dictate its purpose. Humans will most certainly cease to
> exist at some point, but before we do, we get to explore ourselves and the
> world around us. We get to experience feelings. We get to share food, books,
> sunrises and be with each other ​​(Kurzgesagt 2016)

> The fact that we’re even able to think about these things is already
> incredible. It’s easy to think of ourselves as separated from everything, but
> this is not true. We are as much the universe as a neutron star, black hole,
> or nebula. Even better, we are its thinking and feeling parts: the central
> organs of the universe. We are truly free in a universe-sized playground, so
> we might as well aim to be happy and build some kind of utopia in the stars.
> It’s not as if we’ve discovered everything there is to know. We don’t
> understand why the rules of the universe are as they are, how life came into
> existence, and what life is. We have no idea what consciousness is or if we
> are alone in the universe. But we can try to find some answers. There are
> billions of stars to visit, diseases to cure, people to help, happy feelings
> to be experienced, and video games to finish. There is so much to do. So,
> wrapping up, you’ve probably used up a good chunk of the time available to
> you. If this is our one shot at life, there is no reason not to have fun and
> live as happily as possible. Bonus points if you made the life of other people
> better. More bonus points if you help build a galactic human empire. Do the
> things that make you feel good. You get to decide whatever this means for you
> (Kurzgesagt 2016)

Above all, you should maintain the mindset that you should do whatever makes you
happy. If you advance technology or lengthen humanity’s survival, great, but you
shouldn’t pursue doing this just because you feel obligated. What’s so
liberating about optimistic nihilism is the emphasis on how individual happiness
is the sole priority. Due to 'happiness' being hard to define, it truly is up to
you to decide what to pursue. Furthermore, you should always be ruthlessly
skeptical of everything I’ve said and what others say, especially the rest of
this blog post.

I want to re-emphasize the importance of Part 1, as there are many unproductive
ways people could go about happiness. We often use happy when we mean
pleasurable–unguaranteed things like parties, food, or a good conversation.
However, what we really want is peace from mind, which we can achieve by working
with the inner voice or meditating. I encourage you to evaluate the climate of
your mind: Does distraction afflict you? Is your brain speeding way too fast and
on too many different tangents? Or, is your mind peaceful?

Another thing to consider about happiness is satisfaction. At the end of some
days, you will feel like you aren’t doing enough. Maybe you finished your
workday and felt like you wasted time and could’ve done much more. Perhaps you
wanted to talk to a friend and did, but it didn’t hit the spot like you were
expecting. Maybe you just have a feeling that you’re underperforming and are
missing out on a great legacy. Some of these feelings could be actionable, but
most of the time, it is plain dissatisfaction. Luckily, researchers have proven
that gratitude can work to help with feelings of dissatisfaction. Kurzgesagt has
a [video](https://youtu.be/WPPPFqsECz0) dedicated to this, and they have made a
book to help ease into practicing gratitude–I have personally found it
incredibly helpful so far.

What about the role of hobbies and passions in happiness? These provide a sense
of purpose as well as fulfillment. However, one thing to watch out for is how
obsession can be consuming—this applies not only to passions but also to people,
games, or even work. A habit can be unhealthy when you neglect your physical or
mental health. You should be fine if you take breaks and give enough time to
your mind. And if you do not have a passion, get inspiration from others, or
keep trying new things in search of one. Don’t let the past deter you from
getting outside your comfort zone. The necessity for recoverability applies to
everything in life—whether you're going to ask someone out or if you're on the
fence about joining a hiking group—but it is especially applicable to anything
involving risks. As said by Trevor Noah, comedian and host of The Daily Show, in
“Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood”:

> Remember the thing that caused the trauma, but don't hold on to the trauma. I
> never let the memory of something painful prevent me from trying something
> new. If you think too much about the ass-kicking your mom gave you, or the
> ass-kicking that life gave you, you'll stop pushing the boundaries and
> breaking the rules. It’s better to take it, spend some time crying, then wake
> up the next day and move on. You’ll have a few bruises and they’ll remind you
> of what happened and that’s okay. But after a while, the bruises fade, and
> they fade for a reason–because now it’s time to get up to some shit again
> (Noah 2016, 90-91)

There's no point in ruminating over things in the past. If there is a problem,
process it, accept it, and change yourself. Of course, you can keep the bruise
as a reminder not to do something next time, e.g., don't be insensitive or fall
for them if something doesn't feel right to you. However, you should be adaptive
so that you don't need to rely on a potentially massive list of dos and don'ts;
this entails having self-awareness and being a good listener.

The final and most important piece on the topic of happiness is a strong mindset
in addition to prioritizing yourself. As said by
[Anna Akana](https://youtu.be/sDVF040qBBo), actress and self-help YouTuber with
nearly 3 million subscribers, “life is only ten percent what happens to us and
ninety percent how we choose to react to it.” You want your mindset to be
empowering and resilient, says Akana. This way, you can overcome setbacks with
ease. For example, if your car broke down, you got fired, or you got into
trouble at school, a strong and empathetic mindset will guide you to recovery.
You could ruminate for eternity or digest the setback and change yourself. One
technique to adopt in your mindset is to place problems into two categories:
ones we can change and ones we cannot. By applying this technique, you will
realize how many things in our lives are not under our control and that there's
no point in getting worried about them. In the case of a broken car, there's no
point in trying to figure out why it failed, no point in worrying about the
appointment you missed, and no point in worrying (too much) about the money. The
reality is that you have a car that broke down. Do what you need to do to fix it
and move on. Likewise, in the case of being fired, accept and own the reality,
then change yourself. Feeling inadequate is normal, but you want to get over
this quickly.

An empathetic, empowering, and resilient mindset not only helps with overcoming
setbacks but also helps with growth. This is not to say that setbacks and
development are mutually exclusive, but instead that setbacks inspire growth.
The quality of change, if it even happens, depends on your mindset. You need to
be evaluative and collaborative with your mind to achieve certainty and clarity
on your current issues. You will be able to notice and understand your
shortcomings, situations where you aren’t feeling right, what relationships are
worth advancing, and what elements of our lives are distractions.

Another benefit of a strong mindset is that you could figure out, or could have
known what to research, anything on the ideas and philosophies listed above—and
even the entire genre of self-help. This requires self-awareness, a strong
subconscious, and a strong inner voice. Put together, the symphony of your mind
might look like this: if you get an inkling that your subconscious is trying to
tell you something, you should try to develop and identify the emotions by
either meditating or listening to/working with the inner voice. From there, you
can determine whether it is a valid concern, and if it is, you can research
possible actions to take to resolve it. There are only two truths: you will die,
and your mind will always be with you. So, you might as well make your mind as
strong and as beautiful as possible.
