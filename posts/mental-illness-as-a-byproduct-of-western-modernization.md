date: '2023-1-17'
description: 'In this blog post, we examine the relationship between mental illness and modernization. We explore the causes of mental illness and how it can be seen as a byproduct of our fast-paced and individualistic society. We also delve into the differences between collectivism and individualism in the context of mental illness and discuss how cultural values can impact how we view and treat mental health. This post offers a nuanced and thought-provoking look at the complex factors contributing to mental illness.'

In primary care physician Dr. Brandon Hidaka’s research paper, “Depression as a Disease of Modernity: Explanations for Increasing Prevalence,” Hidaka (2012) directly addresses two fundamental questions:

1. Have depression rates increased as a result of modernization?
2. If so, what are the exact reasons?

Firstly, what exactly is modernity? As defined by Hidaka (2012), it is a continuous concept that begins with agriculture, followed by industrialization, urbanization, and ever-accelerating changes in technology and social structure. For the context of Hidaka’s paper, “Modernization” is loosely defined as the conglomeration of a society’s urbanization, industrialization, technological advancement, secularization, consumerism, and westernization. Furthermore, for clarification, “Depression” refers to the symptoms that define major depressive disorder (MDD).

Hidaka begins by introducing known “diseases of modernity.” These include atherosclerosis, hormone-related and gastrointestinal cancers, osteoporosis, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. As the leading cause of morbidity and mortality, diseases of modernity are the greatest threat to public health in the developed world (Yach et al., 2006, as cited in Hidaka, 2012). The purpose of Hidaka’s paper is that we want to know if depression should also be considered a “disease of modernity.”

A hindrance in this study is that it is hard to examine depression rates over time due to the differences in how depression is classified today. Hidaka does, however, confirm a recent rising prevalence of depression in America, and it has continued to this day: The prevalence of MDD is extraordinarily high and growing over time; between 2005 and 2018, the number of adults in the USA diagnosed with MDD increased from 13.7 million to 17.5 million, with the prevalence rate rising from 6.8 to 7.1% (Greenberg et al., 2015; Greenberg et al., 2021, as cited in Proudman et al., 2021)

As evidence for the hypothesis of depression as a byproduct of modernization, Hidaka compares the Lifetime Risk of Mood Disorders vs. GDP. Indeed, it does seem odd to use GDP as there are other factors, e.g., health and inequality (we will cover this later), but the point is to have GDP represent modernization. Comparing countries on various GDP per capita shows that lifetime risk of mood disorder and GDP per capita trends towards statistical significance (IMF, 2010; Kessler et al., 2007; as cited in Hidaka 2012). The United States, for example, has the highest GDP per capita at $45k and the highest lifetime risk of mood disorder at 32%. In contrast, Mexico and Lebanon have around $14k GDP per capita but a lifetime risk of mood disorder at 20%. We also observe this trend of modernization resulting in depression in American immigrants and new cohorts:

> Adoption of the American lifestyle appears to explain higher rates of depression in Mexican Americans born in the U.S. compared to Mexican immigrants (Vega et al., 2004, as cited in Hidaka, 2012). As metropolitan China has undergone a rapid cultural transformation over recent decades, the risk of suffering from depression appears to have risen dramatically: in a retrospective study, Chinese born after 1966 were calculated to be 22.4 times more likely to suffer from a depressive episode during their lifetime compared to those born earlier than 1937 (Lee et al., 2007, as cited in Hidaka, 2012)

Since modernization correlates with an increased risk of depression, we wonder what specific components of modern Western culture contribute to this phenomenon. A decline in physical well-being is a prime suspect. Let us revisit the diseases of modernity:

### Obesity

A systematic review of prospective studies found a reciprocal cause-and-effect relationship between obesity/overweight and depression: i.e., obese individuals had a 55% increased risk of developing depression compared to those of average weight at follow-up, and depressed individuals were 58% more likely to become obese than those not depressed (Luppino et al., 2010, as cited in Hidaka 2012).

### Diet

The composition of the typical Western diet has been implicated as directly contributing to the incidence of obesity and chronic diseases via its alteration of metabolic and endocrine function (Cordain et al., 2005; Eaton et al., 2010; Pollan, 2008; as cited in Hidaka 2012). Furthermore, we have compromised nutrient density in favor of quantity, thus increasing the prevalence of various nutrient deficiencies (Colino, 2022). The most substantial evidence for the influence of individual nutrients on mental health exists for ω-3 PUFA, whose clinical significance is an active area of research in the fields of child development, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and mental illness (Riediger et al., 2009).

The Mediterranean diet is one traditional dietary pattern validated in population-based and intervention studies to improve physical health and quality of life (Muñoz et al., 2008; Serra Majem et al., 2006; Sofi, 2009; as cited in Hidaka, 2012). A large prospective study found that adherence to the Mediterranean diet was protective against the self-reported development of depression (Sánchez-Villegas et al., 2009, as cited in Hidaka, 2012). In particular, flavone luteolin, common in the Meditteranean diet (olives and olive oil), has numerous benefits: anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, microglia inhibition, neuroprotection, memory increase, and helps diet-induced obesity and reduces brain fog (Theoharides et al., 2015). Activation of microglia is common in autism spectrum disorders and possibly mental disorders (Kritas et al., 2014b, as cited in Theoharides et al., 2015).

### Physical Activity

While it is not to say it is a cure for depression, exercise appears to reduce depressive symptoms (Dunn and Dishman, 1991, as cited in Hidaka, 2012).

### Light and Sleep

Decreased exposure to bright light and circadian dysregulation is the proximate cause of the seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Proper endocrine function and increased dopamine and serotonin release are the presumed mechanisms by which light therapy alleviates SAD and MDD (Golden et al., 2005; Lambert et al., 2002; Tuunainen et al., 2004; as cited in Hidaka, 2012).

### Social Environment

Accumulating evidence indicates that the social environment in modern-industrialized countries, especially in the United States, has become increasingly competitive, threatening, and socially isolating. Furthermore, there is a trend of higher lifetime risk of a mood disorder and a country’s Gini coefficient when using data from all countries in the World Mental Health survey initiative (Davies et al., 2008; Kessler et al., 2007; as cited in Hidaka 2012). Inequality has risen in modernized countries, and unequal societies tend to have lower overall health and higher levels of social distrust, competition, and status anxiety (Wilkinson et al., 2009; Wilkinson & Pickett, 2006; as cited in Hidaka, 2012).

People are also becoming lonelier. For example, in 1985, the General Social Survey found that the mean and mode for the number of confidants one can comfortably discuss sensitive issues with were 3 and 3. However, in 2004, a repeat survey revealed that the mean and mode had dropped to 2 and 0 (McPherson et al., 2006, as cited in Hidaka 2012). Lastly, a rise in psychopathology among young adults has been attributed to a shifting cultural emphasis away from intrinsic goals, e.g., social relationships, community, and competence, to extrinsic goals, like money, status, and appearance (Twenge et al., 2010, as cited in Hidaka 2012).

## Western and Non-Western Modernization

Throughout Hidaka’s analysis of various countries and their lifetime risk of mood disorder, there is an outlier: Japan–as it is a country with a high GDP but a low risk of mood disorder. Many factors likely contribute to this: for one, the Japanese exhibit a relatively low degree of inequality for a highly modern, capitalistic society (capitalism generally leads to higher inequality, as shown by the Gini coefficient). Another possible explanation is that Japan has an extremely low prevalence of obesity in addition to high consumption of seafood products (omega-3). Nevertheless, perhaps the most thought-provoking factor is how cultural emphasis on collectivism, as opposed to individualism, may also add to a social environment protective against the development of depression (Kitayama et al., 1997; Oyserman et al., 2002; as cited in Hidaka, 2012).

It is tough to confirm that one particular view of the self is related to the risk of depression. For one, there are too many factors–we must consider ethnicity, sense of self, economic status, physical status, and family. Throughout an analysis of 19 different studies, Oyserman et al. (2002) also found that many variables are possibly confounding, decreasing the impact of results. However, the generally held belief is that collectivism (COL) protects against depression. This is at least the case for East Asian cultures: several studies show that “the positive association between stress and suppression on one hand and depression on the other is mitigated in those who are high in collectivism” (Cheung & Park, 2010; Lay et al., 1998; Su et al., 2013; as cited in Knyazev et al., 2017). Additionally, studies have shown that COL may lead to greater well-being for those living in an individualistic (IND) society:

> COL positively correlated with psychological adjustment among European Americans but not among minority individuals or when levels of family support and acculturation were controlled (Ebreo, 1998). COL also moderated the relation between experiencing daily hassles and depression among Vietnamese Canadian adults (Lay et al., 1998, Study 4), again suggesting a potentially positive impact of COL on well-being among Americans (and Canadians) (Oyserman et al., 2002)

> Well-being was negatively correlated with IND and positively correlated with COL for European Americans, but this relation disappeared when racial identity was controlled (Bettencourt & Dorr, 1997, Studies 1 and 2, as cited in Oyserman et al. 2002)

Note the caveats in the evidence above; we can conclude that COL increases well-being only under certain conditions. Despite this trend, other studies have shown that the opposite is true. In a 2017 survey, Knyazev et al. (2017) found that "in Russia, in sharp contrast with collectivist East Asian cultures, IND rather than COL orientation may act as a protective factor for depression.” Russia is a mix of IND and COL, theoretically avoiding the bias of distress caused by a mismatch of sense of self between an individual and society. Oyserman et al. (2002) also list an example of where IND led to greater well-being for some:

> Studies have found that the IND ideal of more control was associated with less depression for European Americans and African Americans, whereas, for Asians and Asian Americans, personal control was unrelated to depression. Congruently, in a sample of European and Asian Americans, anxiety and depression correlated negatively with independent self-construals and positively with interdependent self-construals (Okazaki, 1997, 2000, as cited in Oyserman et al. 2002)

The results above suggest IND values benefit mental well-being, even for those with a somewhat COL background. However, this cohort may feel pressured to conform to IND ideals in an IND society; some may reject their parent’s COL values. Oyserman et al. (2002) confirm that there is greater happiness when someone living in an IND society satisfies IND ideals.

As for the argument of COL reducing mental illness in East Asian cultures, it is necessary to consider how many COL countries, especially Korea and Japan, have an intense stigma against mental health. While Japan has a low prevalence of depression compared to West Europe and America (Hidaka, 2012; Kutty, 2022), it has a high suicide rate (Kutty, 2022). Furthermore, Japan has a low counseling usage rate: only 6% of people have used psychological counseling for mental health problems, compared to 52% in Europe and the US (Nishimura, 2022, as cited in Kutty, 2022). This factor makes it hard to validate the claims that COL protects against depression and increases happiness in COL societies.

Because of the conflicting evidence, the number of variables, and potential undiagnosed cases due to mental health stigma, we cannot conclude that COL will benefit everyone. Nevertheless, a good approach is to view the two construals regarding their tradeoffs. Then, hopefully, the societies we live in will evolve to prioritize protecting against the development of depression.

> Individualism fosters the pursuit of self-actualization but at the expense of social isolation (Triandis, 2001). On the other hand, collectivism provides social support and feelings of belonging but also brings anxiety about not meeting social obligations. (Knyazev et al. 2017)

## Conclusion

Hidaka’s work evaluates the evidence for rising rates of depression and offers various areas an individual can improve. Shortly after this paper was published, Hidaka’s professor invented a method designed to counter modernization's adverse, physical side effects called Therapeutic Lifestyle Change (TLC). Disclaimer: this is not to say TLC is a cure for depression, as there is also a significant mental component to depression. What we can take away from Hidaka’s work is awareness of some of the modern struggles we face today due to our environment, such as loneliness, competition, and individualism. From there, we can take further steps to address these problems if any affect us.
