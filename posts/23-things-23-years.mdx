1. Banding together over shared distaste for something is a dangerous path. Be
   open minded
2. 10% of your time should be spent on something productive, e.g., art, writing
3. Sometimes, people are only in your life for a certain amount of time just for
   really important things. And that’s beautiful
4. If you laugh, you cry and think, that’s a full day. That’s a heck of a day.
   You do that seven days a week, and you’ll have something special.
5. Either fully commit or not at all.
6. Empathy is humanity’s greatest invention.
7. Being a good listener means providing evaluative and descriptive feedback
   while avoiding your biases. Ask open and honest questions while avoiding
   distraction, and be curious.
8. Awareness is true intelligence, but awareness does not equate to action. Hold
   yourself accountable.
9. Judgment leads to you becoming blind to your own shortcomings.
10. Learn to identify how you’re feeling and how to process emotions. But
    self-sufficiency leads to loneliness—talking through it with a good friend
    is ideal; plus, they will give feedback or take opinions from sides you
    couldn’t think of yourself
11. You do not “own” every thought that arises in your head. Many can be let go.
    Some just need to shout before exiting. Some need more work.
12. Dishwashers save water.
13. Gratitude is the antidote to dissatisfaction.
14. Learn to feel when you’re in a spiral or have clarity. Achieve clarity
    through brain dumps or meditation.
15. Practice self-love—others see us how we see ourselves.
16. Studies show that the mere presence of a phone on the table increases our
    susceptibility to distraction.
17. There is no such thing as a singular purpose or meaning. We can find meaning
    in multiple things in life, even leisure! But some may cause us to feel like
    we aren’t spending our time well, like TV.
18. A logical view of life is insane. Mathematics is the only facet of life
    where anything can be 100% perfect. Humans are governed by emotions.
19. A relationship is something you add to your life, not adapt to fit it in or
    be dependent on.
20. Keep up with friends. Experience life together—once a year big trip sorta
    thing
21. Don’t be an old person afraid of everything. SF is not a warzone.
22. Comparison is the Thief of Joy - Theodore Roosevelt
23. Living in a highly individualistic society, it is crucial to be aware of
    collectivism present in other cultures. Find your balance.
